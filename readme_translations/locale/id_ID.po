Otherwise, you can set your language by turning off the ``auto_locale`` feature, and then setting the locale environmental variable (``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES`` or ``LANG``) to one of our supported languages. Meanwhile, you can help to translate this project into your languages on `our Crowdin page`_."
